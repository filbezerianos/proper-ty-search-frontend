These images are then analysed by our AI model, which is fine tuned to detect specific features such as natural light in rooms, presence of carpets, and more. Each image is rated across different criteria, and these ratings are combined to create an overall score for each property. When you search with specific preferences, the results are filtered and ranked based on these scores to match your preferences as closely as possible.")
